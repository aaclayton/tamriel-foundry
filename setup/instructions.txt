Here are the basic instructions for configuring a clean local installation of the Tamriel Foundry theme.

1) Create a clean WordPress installation.

2) Before importing anything, install latest versions of the following essential plugins:

	1. BuddyPress - http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/
	2. bbPress - http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/
	3. BuddyPress Pending Activations - http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-pending-activations/
	4. jQuery Colorbox - http://wordpress.org/plugins/jquery-colorbox/
	5. Members - http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/
	6. WordPress Console - http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-console/
	
3) Download the "bpcustom.php" file from the "setup" folder of the repo. Place this folder in your plugins directory: /wp-content/plugins/

4) Download the "apocryphatwo" theme from the repo. Unpack this folder in /wp-content/themes/apocryphatwo

5) Download the database file localfoundry.sql from the "setup" folder of the repo, import all the tables into your local database.

6) Download and unzip the media attachments for the lorem ipsum content "uploads.7z". Unpack this content into /wp-content/uploads/

7) You should now have replicated my local install which contains the following:

	* 3 Users
	* 7 Posts
	* 5 Pages
	* 6 Forums
	* 5 Topics
	* 4 Replies
	* 7 Comments
	* 2 Groups
	* 3 Slides
	
8) You can access two of pregenerated user accounts:

	* Username/Password: Zaydok/zaydok - Has admin rights
	* Username/Password: TestUser/testuser
	
9) Feel free to branch out from here, and create content as necessary for your own testing purposes. I hope these instructions work...but they may not.
