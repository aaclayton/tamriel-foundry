Here are the basic instructions for configuring a clean local installation of the Tamriel Foundry theme.

1) Create a clean WordPress installation.

2) Before importing anything, install latest versions of the following essential plugins:

	1. BuddyPress - http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/
	2. bbPress - http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/
	3. BuddyPress Pending Activations - http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-pending-activations/
	4. jQuery Colorbox - http://wordpress.org/plugins/jquery-colorbox/
	5. Members - http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/
	6. WordPress Console - http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-console/

3) Download the "bpcustom.php" file from the "setup" folder of the repo. Place this file in your plugins directory: /wp-content/plugins/

4) Download the "apocryphatwo" theme from the repo. Unpack this folder in /wp-content/themes/apocryphatwo

5) Remove all tables from your local database that were added with the Wordpress install.

6) If you are using the default location of localhost/tamrielfoundry, skip to step 8. If you're using a different location for development your local database, open up localfoundry.sql in your favorite code editor and find all instances of "localhost/tamrielfoundry" and replace with the location you are using on your local machine, i.e. "dev.tamrielfoundry.com".

7) Download the database file localfoundry.sql from the "setup" folder of the repo, import all the tables into your local database.

8) Download and unzip the media attachments for the lorem ipsum content "uploads.7z". Unpack this content into /wp-content/uploads/

9) You should now have replicated my local install which contains the following:

	* 3 Users
	* 7 Posts
	* 5 Pages
	* 6 Forums
	* 5 Topics
	* 4 Replies
	* 7 Comments
	* 2 Groups
	* 3 Slides

10) You can access two of pregenerated user accounts:

	* Username/Password: Zaydok/zaydok - Has admin rights
	* Username/Password: TestUser/testuser

11) Feel free to branch out from here, and create content as necessary for your own testing purposes. I hope these instructions work...but they may not.
