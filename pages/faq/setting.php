			<h2>The Timeline of TESO</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Elder Scrolls Online is set approximately 1,000 years before the events of Skyrim, during the Second Era. The game occurs during a previously unexplored period of the Elder Scrolls timeline known as the "interregnum". It is recorded that these years marked a period of great conflict in Tamriel, but otherwise the setting was an ideal blank slate to use for MMO development.<sup><a href="#ref">(G4E3),(GI7)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The throne of Cyrodil and control over the empire is in constant conflict during this time. The Imperial faction is becoming active in Tamriel, but the game takes place before the ascendancy of the Septim dynasty in the Third Era.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI7)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Akaviri Invasion occurs just before the time frame of the MMO, and serves as a political motivation for the formation of player factions, the Ebonheart Pact in particular. The repercussions of this invasion are still being resolved during the scope of TES:O.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI7)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Geography and Provinces</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The game world consists of most of the continent of Tamriel. Including the provinces of Skyrim, Morrowind, Summerset Isle, Elsweyr, Hammerfell, and Cyrodiil.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GSE3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Not all provinces will be fully included at launch, in order to reserve ares for use in game expansions. Zenimax Online wants to adhere to a high standard of quality for the areas which are included at release, therefore certain areas will be initially unexplorable.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The game's art style is designed to give each province a distinct feel. Zones within a province are further differentiated to feature variety while conforming to the overall provincial theme. Due to Zenimax Online's high degree of cooperation with Bethesda, many of the art assets from Oblivion and Skyrim were able to be adapted or directly utilized for the Elder Scrolls Online.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI10)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The climate of Cyrodiil will be portrayed in the same way it was presented in Oblivion. Some lore resources reference Cyrodiil as originally featuring a jungle climate and ecosystem. According to legend, Tiber Septim transformed Cyrodiil into a temperate province following his ascension to Emperor and Divine. ZeniMax Online has decided to make the appearance of Cyrodiil comparable to the vision presented by Bethesda in TESIV - Oblivion.<sup><a href="#ref">(TWIT)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Elder Scrolls Online features a day/night cycle which allows time to progress naturally during gameplay, Paul Sage has revealed a full day cycle to last approximately 8 hours of real time. Specific details of any gameplay implications, if any, of this system are unknown.<sup><a href="#ref">(IGT1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Certain regions of Elsweyr and Blackmarsh are excluded on the grounds that these areas are still deeply afflicted by the deadly Knahaten Flu which makes their habitation entirely unsafe.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO7)</a></sup></li>

			<h2>Storyline</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The primary force of evil driving the plot events of TES:O is the sinister plot of the Daedric prince of domination, Molag Bal, who seeks to subjugate all of Tamriel under his will.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Playable characters in TES:O are adventurers whose souls have been stolen by Molag Bal. This procedure explains player resurrection within the fiction of the game.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Molag Bal has devised Daedric machinery called Dark Anchors, capable of merging the world of Tamriel with his native realm of Coldharbour. An ancient prophecy, given in the Elder Scrolls themselves, predicts that the "Souless One" alone is capable of thwarting Molag Bal's plans. Working to reclaim their soul from Molag Bal is one of the overarching plot threads for the game.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO7)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Mannimarco, King of Worms has been enlisted to provide the Imperial armies with a constant supply of reanimated corpses. Directly working for Abnur Tharn, the ruling patriarch of the Tharn family in the Imperial City, Mannimarco's necromancy fuels the forces of the Tharn's armies.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Tharn family, and the empire in general is quite weak at this point in time. The Tharn's are secretly Daedra worshipers. The weakness of the empire coupled with the discovery of the Tharm's cultist leanings provides direct incentive for the three competing alliances to sieze the throne and restore peace and order to the Empire.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Mannimarco is secretly conspiring with Molag Bal to assist the prince's plot to dominate Tamriel. Mannimarco is a pivotal figure throughout Elder Scrolls lore, and TES:O will give players the chance to confront him at the height of his power.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI7)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Maormer or "Sea Elves" of Pyandonea will appear in the game as an NPC race.<sup><a href="#ref">(TWIT)</a></sup></li>
