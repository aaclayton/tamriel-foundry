			<h2>What Is The Elder Scrolls Online?</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Zenimax Media is the parent company which owns both Zenimax Online Studios and Bethesda Game Studios. The two sibling studios have a close working relationship which has allowed ZOS to collaborate effectively with Bethesda in order to maintain internal consistency in lore, geography, and art design. Todd Howard is personally involved to sign off on major decisions regarding the direction of the IP.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Under the direction of Matt Firor (pronounced fire-ore), veteran lead developer of Dark Age of Camelot (and expansions), Zenimax Online Studios has a 250 person team comprised of industry veterans and Elder Scrolls fans.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Firor was hired shortly after Oblivion was released specifically to lead the Elder Scrolls Online project. His goal is to combine the deeply immersive PvE experience of traditional Elder Scrolls games with the excitement of three faction PvP in the spiritual mold of Dark Age of Camelot.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The game's creative director, Paul Sage, was brought on both because of his experience in MMO development and his fanaticism for the Elder Scrolls IP.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Original titles that were considered for the game included Elder Scrolls: Online, Elder Scrolls: Origins, Tamriel, and Elder Scrolls: Empires.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The business model and possible subscription fee for Elder Scrolls Online has not yet been announced.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI10)</a></sup></li>

			<h2>Development Schedule</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Zenimax Online Studios (ZOS) was formed in 2007.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The game has officially been scheduled for release in Spring 2014.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO5)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The official Elder Scrolls Online website launched on October 24, 2012. There is no official ESO forum at this time.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The game has entered closed beta, and is currently accepting applications for interested beta testers. Beta testing will feature both open and closed phases.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ESO is actively being tested by hundreds of developers and quality assurance personnel.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The game will adhere to genre standards like classes, experience points, and progression. The player will gain experience by slaying enemies, exploring the world, and completing quests or objectives within the world.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI10)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Elder Scrolls Online is designed to provide an experience that feels familiar to fans of the single player games, while providing deep and challenging MMO mechanics for veterans of the genre.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Elder Scrolls Online will use a traditional class system rather than free-form character progression; however, any character can wear any armor type and wield any weapon type. This allows for a tremendous variety of character building options despite revolving around a fundamental class system.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ESO does feature a main quest line, but players can start it at their own discretion with no penalty for being "late". The main story line of the game is balanced to be completely soloable, although the game is tailored to provide a social community experience.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There exist certain quest choices which mold your character as a result of your decisions. The outcome of certain quests will cause a tangible impact on areas of the world.<sup><a href="#ref">(G4E3),(GI8)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Key "touchstones" of the Elder Scrolls IP will all be present in the MMO. Daedric princes, eight divines (no Talos in ESO!), constellations, and spell schools will all be familiar elements.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The ESO gameplay experience is designed to be "distraction based", in that instead of following an on-rails trajectory of advancement, players explore the world and encounter quests, dungeons, and events which are strategically placed to emphasize exploration and non-guided advancement.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI3)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="technology" class="faq-section">

			<h2>Technology</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The Elder Scrolls Online will launch for PC, Mac, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO5)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ZOS originally licensed HeroEngine to use as a development bridge in order to prototype areas and game concepts while the studio developed its own proprietary engine for Elder Scrolls Online.<sup><a href="#ref">(PGH1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Elder Scrolls Online features an engine that supports a similar real-time combat model to that which has featured in recent TES games.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The game's engine is specifically designed to stably support keep sieges and PvP battles displaying up to 200 concurrent players on-screen. Zenimax Online's design goal is to create the largest (stable) player battles of any MMO.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GSE3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Unlike most MMOs which feature separate "shards" or game server, the entire player population of The Elder Scrolls Online will coexist within one single "megaserver". This single server will remove barriers to grouping with friends, as well as eliminate issues related to server capacity like queues or mergers.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The megaserver relies on intelligent placement of players into game spaces, where your assigned instance is contingent on the presence of friends, guildmates, and gameplay preferences which you specify prior to launch.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>PC and Mac players will share a megaserver, while Xbox One and Playstation 4 players will each have a separate megaserver specific to players on that console.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO6)</a></sup></li>
			<li>A design goal for ZOS is that TES:O be playable on both PC and Mac, and have unrestrictive system requirements such that any modern laptop can comfortably play it. In order to accomodate both this lower hardware threshold and high performance users, the TES:O engine is designed to feature a high degree of scalability in graphical and rendering capability. No Linux release is planned at this time.<sup><a href="#ref">(PGH1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ESO takes advantage of DirectX11 and the Havok physics engine. Additionally it offers support for multiple CPU cores which proves especially helpful during large scale AvA battles. ZeniMax is working closely with ATI and nVidia to ensure that ESO takes advantage of the latest generation of graphics cards, including SLI and CrossFire technology.<sup><a href="#ref">(PGH1),(TF3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>TES:O will be playable in both 3rd and 1st person views. The player can zoom all the way in to first person, but this may place you at a tactical disadvantage on the battlefield. Early in development, first person view was not fully developed, and ZeniMax was unsure if they were going to include a "true" first person perspective on ESO. In response to a considerable amount of fan feedback as well as their desire to stay true to their Elder Scrolls heritage, they have prioritized adding first person perspective which includes visible hands, weapons, and attack animations.<sup><a href="#ref">(G4E3),(GSE3),(DE1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ZOS is emphasizing that visual cues for enemy abilities that require various player responses are prominently displayed in the world rather than simply as a UI element. Instead of using interface prompts like cast bars or text warnings, players will be required to watch the physical movements of enemies in order to anticipate their attacks.<sup><a href="#ref">(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ZeniMax recognizes the strong role of the modding community in Elder Scrolls franchise, and certain aspects of the game experience, like the UI, will allow for user customization, reskinning, and limited modification. ESO will support LUA based modifications that will allow modders to interact with the game's systems through an API. This will allow modders to create interface based modifications like enhanced combat text or buff timers.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI3),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Entire provinces are not seamless, but rather feature short (but unobtrusive) loading screens while moving from zone to zone. Various reasons for this decision include meeting performance and instancing requirements for the megaserver, as well as enabling more efficient phasing of locations.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
