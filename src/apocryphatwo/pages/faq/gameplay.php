			<h2>General Mechanics</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>There will be a level cap of 50, and ZOS expects it to take an average player approximately 120-150 hours of gameplay to reach the cap. Reaching level 10, typically involves around 15 hours of gameplay.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Player characters are controlled using the mouse and WASD keys with a reticle on the screen that allows for the targeting of monsters, NPCs, or other players.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The sneak function is activated by pressing the CTRL key. Bonuses to the effectiveness of stealth can be acquired through leveling medium armor.<sup><a href="#ref">(IGN1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>A side effect of the stamina system is that groups are somewhat less restricted to utilizing rigid roles in composition. Since all players have the ability to block and escape crowd control, players are more responsible for their personal well-being and less reliant on a dedicated healer to carry them through fire. ESO does, however, resemble a trinity system and having a party member who is specialized in taking damage is important for a balanced group. However, groups of enemies in ESO are designed so that it is not possible for a single tank to maintain the attention of every foe.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Enemies are designed individually pose a challenge, and be more than "speedbumps" in the player's quest. Groups of foes will work collectively to support each other and use control abilities to counter a player party. The behaviors of enemies in PvE are designed to mirror player classes. The same abilities and mechanics are therefore important for both PvE and PvP. It is an important design goal that combat versus monsters has the same feel as combat versus players. Monster AI is also designed to emulate player behavior; ranged attackers will fan out, sturdy meleers will protect fragile casters, and healers will seek cover behind other mobs.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI9),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>"Aggro" tables of NPC enemies are less rigidly defined, and they may systematically switch targets in combat. This further emphasizes the need for players to assert personal responsibility for defending themselves in combat, rather than relying on traditional aggro management.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Characters can utilize an "alternate" weapon slot, allowing the player to quickly switch between weapon sets in combat.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Unlike in Skyrim, spells in ESO do not have to be equipped in a dedicated hand or hands, but rather may be used simultaneously with weapon attacks off of the character's hotbar.<sup><a href="#ref">(PCG2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There are two targetting systems in ESO. The first is the default system of "soft-lock" targetting which essentially assists the player in aiming attacks and projectiles provided they have their reticle aimed reasonably closely to an enemy player or monster. Allow your reticle to stray too far away from your target, and  your attacks will miss altogether. The second targetting system is similar to "tab-targetting", this allows you to focus a specific enemy within a group to manually specify the target of your attacks. An important note with this system is that you are still required to aim your attacks towards your target. The tab locking simply exists to help you specify which enemy out of a crowd of multiple targets is the focus of your attacks.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Projectiles feature guided flight, rather than true physics detection. Therefore, your spells and arrows will seek your soft-locked target to some degree, bypassing intervening enemies.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="combat" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Combat Systems</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The currently equipped weapon determines the player's available left mouse attacks, a normal left-click triggers a precise "light" attack, while holding left mouse initiates a hard-hitting "heavy" attack. Enemy monsters will use the same combination of light and power attacks against the player.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>In order to enhance the action-combat feel, combat focuses around the opportunistic use of a stamina bar which allows the player to sprint, block, interrupt, and escape crowd control. By selectively using these strategic abilities, combat in TES:O feels dynamic, despite adhering to turn-based fundamentals which are critical to MMO design. All classes have access to block, sprint, and crouch.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(PCG1),(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Holding right mouse button engages active blocking mode, intercepting incoming blows at the cost of stamina. While blocking, a left click executes a shield (or weapon) bash, interrupting enemy spellcasting or breaking free of crowd control effects. If you block a power attack, your target is dazed and becomes vulnerable.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Your weapon's power attacks will apply certain additional properties if an enemy is currently afflicted by certain states. For example, if an enemy spellcaster is dazed after being interrupted, a follow-up power attack will apply additional damaging effects.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Double tapping a movement key allows your character to perform an active dodge, consuming some stamina in order to evade an incoming attack.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Each class slots five hotbar abilities which chosen from their class pool. These abilities have no cooldown, but cost either stamina or magicka to activate. Each ability is designed to have a substantial impact on combat, so the selective use of when and how to use these skills plays a major role in combat success.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The final (sixth) hotbar slot for every class is filled by an ultimate ability which is usable after the player accumulates sufficient "finesse", a resource mechanic that builds through successful performance in combat. Every class has multiple ultimate abilities to choose from, but may only utilize one at a time. Bonus finesse is awarded for "playing smart", for example interrupting an enemy spellcast or blocking a dangerous attack. Groups can rapidly accumulate finesse by performing attack combos that use synergistic abilities to produce a special effect. Completing an encounter with high finesse yields additional rewards ranging from a small experience boost to additional magical loot.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>When you first slot a new ability in your hotbar, you only possess a novice level of skill using it. As you gain expertise in your abilities you can improve and enhance them in various ways.<sup><a href="#ref">(ME3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Combat, class, and ultimate abilities may be changed whenver you want, provided you are not in combat. Because TESO uses a smaller number of active combat abilities than other games, the design team is ensuring that every ability a player can use is awesome and powerful, while eliminating filler abilities that provide only supplementary benefit.<sup><a href="#ref">(PCG1),(GI9)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There is a system to actively swap out weapons mid-combat including the set of skills tied to that weapon. Weapon swapping costs a certain amount of stamina and magicka. This ability is unlocked at level 15.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(IGN1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>A quick potion slot, activated with Q, allows players to drink an alchemical mixture in the middle of combat, although the use of this potion slot features a short (20-30 second) cooldown. In addition to these instant-use potions, there are also draughts and foods which can buff the player for a longer duration and are useable before combat.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There exist potent synergy abilities, where multiple players working together can create a powerful magical effect by combining multiple abilities. These cross-class combo opportunities will prompt visual cues on-screen to help parties effectively combine powers. For example, a mage may combine a fire storm with a warrior who can run into the area of effect and use bladestorm, spraying fireballs in a 360 degree radius.<sup><a href="#ref">(GSE3),(GI9)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Enemy creatures will work together if they cross paths and the enemy UI is smart enough to exploit the same synergies against the player. Enemies can and will team up to use their superior numbers against the player. These synergy abilities work both ways, and a successful group will have to both employ their own cross-class combos, as well as prevent their enemies from doing the same. Enemies also have have factional synergy; opponents belonging to the same political group can combine their abilities for combat bonuses unique to that group.<sup><a href="#ref">(GSE3),(GI9),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Healing abilities are avaliable as class abilities for many classes, as well as weapon abilities when using the Restoration Staff weapon type. Most heals are either radial or conal area-of-effect, although some single target healing abilities exist.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="exploration" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Exploration</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Players are initially restricted to exploring the lands of only their own faction, as well as the contested AvA area of Cyrodiil after they reach level 10. Upon completing their main alliance storyline, they can elect to explore the provinces of an alternate alliance.<sup><a href="#ref">(TWIT),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The world is split up into provinces, regions, and zones. It is not fully seamless, and some short loading screens are present when moving between zones.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The in-game map will mark key locations, quests, and places of interest. Many caves, ruins, or dungeons will not become marked on the map until they are discovered by the player, or described by an NPC. The map icons for various locations are familiar to players of Skyrim, denoting caves, towns, shrines, and more with their own identifying markers.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Quests are discoverable using the mini-map, where an icon will appear when you are near a quest-giving NPC or object. NPCs worth talking to will glow a light shade of yellow, indicating they offer a quest or advance an an objective.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(GN1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>A compass will help direct the player towards nearby towns, dungeons, and places of interest, this feature is intended to preserve the feeling of a traditional single player TES experience. The compass is one of many UI elements which may be disabled if the player prefers.<sup><a href="#ref">(ME3),(GI8)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ZOS is designed to reward exploration with "vignettes" that are small events or challenges which are hidden off the beaten path around the world. Additionally, exploration will lead to the discovery of additional quests, loot, and possibly achievements throughout the world.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI8),(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Fast travel as existed in Oblivion and Skyrim will not be allowed in the MMO. Instead, Wayshrines will allow players to traverse large distances between a set of fixed points, however, players must discover the target Wayshrine before using it for travel.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Mounts will be in the game, but will conform to existing Elder Scrolls lore. Horses are the primary mode of personal transportation in Tamriel, and TESO will remain consistent on this point. Players should not expect to obtain flying mounts or other exotic steeds.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI10)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="crafting" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Crafting</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Crafting, alchemy, and soul stones will all exist in the MMO. The crafting system in ESO is discovery based, but otherwise similar to that of Skyrim. The following craft skills will be available at launch: Provisioner, Weaponsmith, Armorer, Alchemist, and Enchanter.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Crafting will play an important role in optimizing the players equipment. Items that drop within the world can be augmented and upgraded by a player crafter. Therefore, the economic and mechanical importance of crafting will remain relevant even at endgame. Crafters will be able to make some of the most powerful items in the game, but there will be a system in place to prevent the mass production of legendary quality items.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1),(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Crafting materials will drop off enemy creatures and their exact function must be determined through experimentation. Each crafting component can have four different effects depending on how it is used.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>During crafting, a primary component and secondary component are combined, plus up to three optional additive components which can be added to change the product created. The quality of each additive can be increased to produce an even more powerful effect.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>You will earn crafting points which you can distribute between the 5 crafting skills. You can use these points to become a jack-of-all-trades and be competant, but not exceptional, in all 5 skills or you can master one skill completely.<sup><a href="#ref">(MR1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Crafting is performed at special stations within the world. Blacksmithing uses an anvil and forge, Alchemy requires an Alchemist's Lab, and Enchanting uses an enchanter's table. Provisioning is done at a cookfire or kitchen.<sup><a href="#ref">(MR1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ZOS wants to preserve a high degree of interactivity within the world, so crafting, hunting, and gathering resources will be important features of the game's economic system. The ability to use and interact with mundane objects throughout the world is an important way to connect the game to the Elder Scrolls IP. You will be able to loot crates, barrels, and chests, and harvest resources throughout the world.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI3),(GSE3),(GI10)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Certain valuable crafting ingredients will only be obtainable from within the AvA enabled regions of Cyrodiil.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
