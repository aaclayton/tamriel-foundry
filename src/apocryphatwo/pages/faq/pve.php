			<h2>Questing</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Questing and story progression will revolve largely around "hubless quest design" in order to preserve the sense of freeform exploration and progression which is an iconic feature of the Elder Scrolls. The game uses focal "points of interest" which are self-contained adventure modules that players may encounter during their travels. Townsfolk will direct players towards nearby POIs, but Zenimax Online is trying to shy away from quest hubs and breadcrumb chains. Many NPCs can direct the player to the same quest, so the player can easily find nearby quests without needing floating exclamation marks or strategy guides.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI8)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Many quests are simple bite-sized adventures, however there are also quest sagas which span entire zones and tell grand tales which reveal segments of the overarching plot line of the game.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>While some quests are acquired from NPCs in major cities and towns, many quests can only be encountered through exploration. Quest givers are often near the enterances of dungeons or other points of interest, where enterprising players can seek them out.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Quest areas are phased, such that depending on a player's progress through the game's story arcs he or she may experience a modified version of towns, dungeons, and NPCs. In order to avoid many of the past pitfalls of phased content, ZOS is allowing any player who has previously completed a story arc to repeat the content with friends.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Quest rewards and public boss drops are individual specific and linked to the player's class. This is to encourage grouping without penalizing players by forcing them to distribute shared loot. Additionally, many quest objectives are automatically shared with nearby players in the world to encourage cooperation, even if players don't actually form a group. Furthermore, there are no kill lockouts. If you assist a fellow player in slaying monsters, both of you will recieve experience and quest credit even if you are not grouped. Zenimax wants to discourage competitiveness within ones own faction, and encourage players to work together against common enemies.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI8),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Almost all of the iconic opponents from previous Elder Scrolls games will be present in TESO, including daedra, giants, and mudcrabs! Each monster type has its own unique and distinct behaviors.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI10),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Dragons will not feature in the MMO at launch, as they are not involved in the history of Tamriel at this time.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Endgame PvE content will be periodically released in the form of "adventure zones", which are dangerous and uncivilized regions of Tamriel within which many dangers lurk. These adventure zones will feature content ranging from solo play, to group encounters, and even additional raid content.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="dungeons" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Dungeons</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>TES:O will feature both public and instanced dungeons. Public dungeons are not separated from the regular world via instancing, and allow for organic cooperation, grouping, and even competition between players. Instanced dungeons also exist, which will deliver a more contained, story driven experience to a group of players. Public dungeons are excellent at providing "drive-by" social experiences with new players by facilitating spontaneous group formation with fellow gamers.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Most small public dungeons located throughout the world are balanced to be challenging for 1.5 players, where they will provide a significant challenge for a solo player, but be comfortably clearable for a small group.<sup><a href="#ref">(GSE3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>ESO will feature 16 four-man instanced dungeons at launch in addition to it's public dungeons throughout the world. On the first run through an instanced dungeon, you will experience it's full story experience. On subsequent runs, you will be able to bypass the story content if desired.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(PA1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Endgame PvE will feature heroic modes of each of the game's instanced dungeons, which are more than simply more difficult versions of the same content. These heroic dungeons extend the story of normal mode dungeons by adding a climactic and challenging endgame experience. In addition the game has large raids that pit multiple groups of players against powerful and iconic bosses.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI3),(GI8)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There are a large number of public dungeons within Cyrodiil as well, which will combine exciting PvE storylines with the challenge and danger of encountering hostile player opposition within. In addition, ZeniMax are working to develop a mega-dungeon, reminiscent of Darkness Falls in Dark Age of Camelot, where access to this dungeon will depend on your faction's success in the realm war.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="loot" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Loot and Gear</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>NPCs will offer both gold and items as quest rewards, however quests do not usually give the player a choice of multiple rewards, since all classes in ESO can use every piece of equipment in the game.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There are no separate itemization paths for PvE and PvP gear in ESO. Gear is useful in a universal context regardless of the means by which it is acquired. TES:O there will have various tiers of powerful gear, some of which will be acquired through PvE, while other pieces will require PvP participation to earn. In order to obtain the best possible equipment for your character, you will need to complete a mixture of all types of game content. Loot from PvE will be useable in PvP and vice versa.<sup><a href="#ref">(ME3),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Many of the other Daedric princes appear in the game in some capacity, although players should not expect to accumulate a all-powerful collection of Daedric artifacts.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="npcguilds" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>NPC Guilds</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The player will be able to join some of the iconic guilds of the Elder Scrolls lore. In order to join and progress within these NPC organizations, the player must first prove himself worthy.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI8)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Fighters Guild is predominately interested in repelling the attempts of Molag Bal to dominate Tamriel. By destroying the demonic Dark Anchors that Molag Bal sends forth from his plane of Coldharbour the player can gain favor with the Fighter's Guild. These Dark Anchors are semi-random dynamic events which require small groups of players to assemble to defeat. The anchors are guarded by Daedra and any able adventurers in the area can assist in killing  them and destroying the anchor.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Mages Guild works to collect and catalogue the many arcane tomes which are scattered across Tamriel. By finding and collecting these books, a player can ingratiate himself with the Mages Guild.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Each of the NPC guilds (Mages and Fighters at launch) has its own unique skill tree which players can advance through, unlocking new abilities unique to that guild.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Thieves Guild is currently under development, but will not be included at launch.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Dark Brotherhood will have a presence in the game, but whether the player can join this organization or the means of doing so are not yet known.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1)</a></sup></li>
