			<h2>Alliance Overview</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The Elder Scrolls Online features a three alliance system, with geographically separated alliances comprised of three races each. Races are restricted by alliance in order to generate and enhance their distinct identity. Each race is physically distinguishable from each other so in world PvP players can easily differentiate friends from foes.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI10)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Players may not invade into the "home" areas beloning to enemy alliances for PvP, Therefore all PvP in ESO takes place within Cyrodiil.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Each alliance's home area is unique, and the distinct identity of a alliances native provinces helps to foster realm pride amongst players and enhance the meta-conflict which fuels the social side of a three alliance realm war. For prolonged success of the AvA meta-game within the fan community, it is very important that players can identify themselves with their alliance and alliance.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI3),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Players can experience the PvE areas of other alliances after completing their own alliance storyline. This mechanic scales the difficulty of PvE areas to level 50 and higher, in a mechanic labelled "50+". Once a player completes the second full faction story arc, they can begin the third and final alliance quest line which is termed "50++". This system dramatically extends the amount of content the game has to offer at launch, and allows for players to continue to be challenged by soloable content at a high level. Although you can explore these other areas once you reach level 50, you'll still only be able to group and socialize with members of your own native alliance.<sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(PCG2)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Imperials constitute a 4th non-playable alliance who have made a pact with Molag Bal and Mannimarco. They serve as a NPC enemy alliance centralized in Cyrodiil, however, their influence spreads throughout Tamriel.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI10)</a></sup></li>

	<div id="aldmeri" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Aldmeri Dominion</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>In the southwest, Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajiit have united to form the Aldmeri Dominion, a new empire intent on imposing unflinching order on the continent. They control the provinces of Valenwood, Summerset Isles, and Elsewyr.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI5)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The leader of the Aldmeri Dominion is Queen Ayrenn, an Altmer. Their capitol of is Elden Root, a great city in the heart of Valenwood. The sigil of the Aldmeri Dominion is an eagle.<sup><a href="#ref">(FB1),(ESO1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Queen Ayrenn seeks Cyrodiil for reasons that are both geopolitical and personal. Before becoming the leader of the Aldmeri Dominion, Ayrenn was an adventurer in Tamriel. She suffered personally at the hands of Abnur Tharn in the Imperial city. Ayrenn believes it is time for the elves to resume their responsibility to rule and to get rid of the warmongering humans.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO3)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="daggerfall" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2>Daggerfall Covenant</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>In the northwest of Tamriel, the Daggerfall Covenant is a democratic alliance between Bretons, Redguard, and Orcs, convened to utilize their collective military might in securing their lands and establishing a safe and profitable hub of commerce. Formed in Wayrest, High Rock under the guidance of High King Emeric, The Daggerfall Covenant controls the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell. The sigil of the Daggerfall Covenant is a lion.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI4),(FB1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Daggerfall Covenant appears to control a smaller area of land than the other alliances, but since not all areas of Tamriel are fully explorable at release, the playable landmass available to each alliance will be roughly identical.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI10)</a></sup></li>
			<li>It is clear to High King Emeric, who is a bit of an amateur historian of Imperial history, that when the Empire is strong, that is when times are peaceful for the people of Tamriel. He sees the Empire as a human endeavor, and currently the humans are failing. In response, the Daggerfall Covenant takes it upon themselves to take charge and prevent the elves from creating greater problems.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO3)</a></sup></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="ebonheart" class="faq-section">
		<header>
			<h2 id="ebonheart">Ebonheart Pact</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>In the northeast, the Ebonheart Pact is a warlike coalition of Nords, Dunmer, Argonians who have temporarily allied in order to fight for their homelands. This uneasy alliance struggles to maintain control of the provinces of Morrowind (and Vvardenfell), Skyrim, and Blackmarsh.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI6)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Ebonheart Pact is led (in name) by Jorunn the Skald-King, however a moot of three leaders, one from each race jointly dictate the Pact's military decisions. The sigil of the Ebonheart Pact is a dragon.<sup><a href="#ref">(FB1),(ESO1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Being more mystically attuned, when the Ebonheart Pact becomes aware of the great threat to Nirn, they mobilize to confront it. Almalexia, one of the living gods of the Tribunal and one of the leaders of the Ebonheart Pact, is told by mystics that Molag Bal processes a great threat to Nirn. This collaboration between the Empire, Molag Bal, and Mannimacro cannot be tolerated, so the Ebonheart Pact decides to march on Cyrodiil.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO3)</a></sup></li>
