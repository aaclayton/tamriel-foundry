			<h2>Overall Class Design</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>All three alliances have access to the same classes. The four playable classes at launch will be Dragonknight, Templar, Sorcerer, and Nightblade. The game had originally featured planned to feature the "Warden" class, as well as possibly a second finesse based class, but ZOS has opted for fewer base classes in favor of more open-ended character progression.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Each class can use every type of weapon in the game as well as every type of armor. As the player uses a particular weapon type they gain skill and further proficiency with that type of armament. All weapons will require practice to master. Mastering a weapon can unlock additional alternative melee attacks that can be slotted.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Players can choose between light, medium, or heavy armor, or can elect to use a mixture of multiple types. Light armor yields bonuses to spell damage and magicka regeneration. Medium armor improves a character's use of stamina-based abilities like dodging, sprinting, or sneaking. Heavy armor grants a bonus to incoming healing recieved as well as damage absorbed.<sup><a href="#ref">(ESO4)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Each class can unlock a wide arsenal of skills and abilities, from which players may choose six to actively use at any given time. These class abilities can be changed on the fly, and reflect a players current "loadout" that can be adapted to various situations. Skill selection is one way in which players can differentiate themselves from others of their class.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(PCG1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Constellations and birthsigns are incorporated into TES:O in the form of Mundus stones, which function similarly to guardian stones in Skyrim, allowing the player to choose a permanent buff associated with a particular constellation. Some Mundus stones also unlock an additional ability for players who have them active.<sup><a href="#ref">(GI1),(GI3)</a></sup></li>

			<h2>Character Advancement Systems</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The major attributes of the game are health, stamina, magicka, armor, and power. At each level up, you can place an attribute point into either health, stamina, or magicka. These attribute points increase your hero's available pool of each resource, allowing them to specialize in a certain style of combat.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Perks exist and will be similar to talents in previous MMOs. Paul Sage emphasized that perks will provide substantial benefit and be pivotal in character development and growth.<sup><a href="#ref">(ME3),(GI3)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Weapon attacks, class skills, and ultimate abilities all level up as you use them in combat. Advancing these skills unlocks improved versions as your mastery improves. Using abilities successfully in combat increases the character's proficiency with that ability, as well as the overall skill type. Higher skill level in a given tree increases the number of abilities a character has access to within that tree. Equipping items and putting skills in your hotbar enables them to level as you defeat enemies, splitting the overall pool of experience across all of your active abilities, armor, and weapons.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1),(GF1),(GN1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>While all classes have a basic proficiency with every weapon and armor type, advanced offensive and defensive abilities are only unlocked through advancing in the relevant skill trees and using skill points to unlock and upgrade their abilities. <sup><a href="#ref">(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There are seven confirmed varieties of skill trees within the game: Class, Weapon, Armor, Racial, World, Guild, and AvA. These categories are (in some cases) further broken down. Each class has three sub-trees, and AvA also features three skill trees. Unique quest based skill trees like those for Lycanthropy or Vampiriism are also present. <sup><a href="#ref">(GF1),(PA1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>There are six overall weapon types which the player can level and unlock special abilities: two-handed, dual wield, one hand and shield, bow, destruction staff, and restoration staff. There are many varities of weapons within each general category, such as daggers, swords, and maces within one-handed, or fire, frost, and lightning staves within destruction staff.<sup><a href="#ref">(MA1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Individual abilities can be leveled up and “morphed” into more advanced versions of the basic form. An ability can be morphed by spending an additional skill point after leveling the individual ability through five ranks. Morphing allows the player to choose between two advanced skills, and this decision can be respecialized if the player changes his/her mind.<sup><a href="#ref">(PA1)</a></sup></li>

			<h2>Class Details</h2>
		</header>
		<ul>
			<li>The Dragonknight is an offensive warrior with many controlling abilities. Dragonknights emphasize direct assaults wielding fire-based spells, preferring to engage and dispatch their foes in melee. The Dragonknight has a combination of damage-dealing, damage absorbing, and armor enhancing abilities.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>The Templar is a stalwart defensive fighter, calling upon the power of the sun to damage foes and heal allies. Templars are less offensive than the Dragonknight, but have additional tools that are useful for survival of both themselves and their allies.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Sorcerers are offensive magicka wielders, channeling elemental attacks to destroy their foes. The Sorcerer class has three damage-dealing skill sets to draw from: Dark Magic grants stuns, disorients, knockbacks, and other types of crowd-control, Daedric Summoning offers combat pets, damage shields, and curses, and Storm Calling gives pure damage-based abilities.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1),(GF1)</a></sup></li>
			<li>Details regarding the Nightblade class have not yet been announced, but we know it will be a finesse based assasin style archetype.<sup><a href="#ref">(TF1)</a></sup></li>
