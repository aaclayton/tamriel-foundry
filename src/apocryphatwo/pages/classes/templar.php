<h2>Aedric Spear</h2>
<p>While there is not spear weapon line in <em>ESO</em>, these skills draw inspiration from the weapon, conjuring a magical spear of light. For the many spear enthusiasts, the Templar class may offer a reasonable chance to incorporate your favorite weapon into your ESO gameplay regardless of whether it is eventually added as an expansion weapon type. These skills reinforce the holy warrior theme of the Templar, but give the player enough tools to remain a versatile and mobile fighter.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>[Ultimate] Radial Sweep</strong> – Sweeps a conjured weapon in a deadly arc, dealing Magic damage to all enemies around you.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Puncturing Strikes</strong> – A four hit attack dealing chained damage to any foes in front of you, the final hit knocks back the closest enemy.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Piercing Javelin</strong> – Hurl a spear, dealing damage and knocking the target backwards.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Focused Charge</strong> – Charge to an enemy, interrupting them and dealing Magic damage.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Spear Shards</strong> – Deals Magic damage to all enemies in a target area. One target is disoriented for a short duration. An ally may pick up the spear granting both of you bonus damage for a short time.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Sun Shield</strong> – Create a damage absorption shield with strength based on your maximum health, dealing damage to nearby enemies on activation. The shield returns a damage and is replenished by a small amount each time it is struck by an enemy. The Templar no longer regenerates Magicka while the shield holds.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Piercing Spear</strong> – Increases the critical strike chance with spear abilities and deal bonus damage to blocking targets.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Spear Wall</strong> – Increase the amount of damage you block while you have a spear ability slotted.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Burning Light</strong> – Adds a chance to deal bonus damage with spear skills.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Balanced Warrior</strong> – Increases your weapon power and spell resistance by a small amount.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dawn’s Wrath</h2>
<p>The <em>Dawn’s Wrath</em> line focuses heavily on damage dealing, channeling the raw power of the Sun to damage, stun, and blind enemies. PRAISE THE SUN! The ranged DPS potential for a Magicka based templar hurling spells from afar seems considerable, and I suspect this may be the go-to tree for glass cannon mages.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>[Ultimate] Nova</strong> – Calls forth a miniature sun at your target location, causing all nearby enemies to deal less damage while taking damage over time. Allies may activate the Supernova synergy, dealing damage and stunning all enemies in the area.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Sun Fire</strong> – Hurls a white-hot projectile at an enemy, dealing both initial damage and additional damage over time. The target is snared for a short duration.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Solar Flare</strong> – Deal damage to the target and any nearby enemies; affected foes takes extra damage from the next attack.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Backlash</strong> – Stores up incoming damage, when the effect ends nearby enemies each take some base damage plus the full amount of damage taken by the Templar during the <em>Backlash</em> duration.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Eclipse</strong> – The Templar reflects negative single target spells back towards enemy casters. Re-casting the <em>Eclipse</em><em> </em>spell becomes more expensive for a short time.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Blinding Light</strong> – Causes all incoming enemy attacks to miss. Sometimes a missed attack causes the attacker to become off-balance.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Enduring Rays</strong> – Increases the duration of all Dawn’s Wrath abilities.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Prism</strong> – Gain additional Ultimate when activating a Dawn’s Wrath ability.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Illuminate</strong> – Take less incoming damage from enemies which are affected by your Dawn’s Wrath abilities.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Restoring Spirit</strong> – Restore a small amount of Magicka when activating an ability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restoring Light</h2>
<p>The <em>Restoring Light</em> skill line provides an intriguing opportunity for players to operate as a full group healer without being constrained to use of the Restoration Staff weapon line. This line is fully compatible with the Paladin-esque feel of the Templar for those who enjoy the holy warrior archetype.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>[Ultimate] Rite of Passage</strong> – Channels a restorative aura; nearby allies take less damage while channeling. Heals the caster while channeling.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Rushed Ceremony</strong> – Heals a nearby wounded ally.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Healing Ritual</strong> – Heals all nearby allies, the caster receives additional healing.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Restoring Aura</strong> – When slotted; you have increased Stamina and Health regeneration. When activated; allies regenerate Health and Stamina at a faster rate.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Cleansing Ritual</strong> – Instantly removes a negative effect from the caster and heals allies in an area. Allies may activate Purify, removing all negative effects.</li>
	<li><strong>[Active] Rune Focus</strong> – Creates an area of self protection, gaining immunity to interrupt effects and taking less damage while the effect lasts.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Master Ritualist</strong> – Increased resurrection speed, players are resurrected with additional health with a chance of not consuming a soul gem in the process.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Light Weaver</strong> – Your <em>Restoring Light</em> abilities gain the following effects; Restoring Aura – duration increased, Healing Ritual – cost reduced, Rite of Passage – take less damage while channeling.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Mending</strong> – Increases the critical strike chance of <em>Restoring Light</em> abilities on allies. The magnitude of increase is based on the amount of health the ally is missing.</li>
	<li><strong>[Passive] Focused Healing</strong> – Increases the healing done to allies standing in your areas of protection (Rite of Passage, Cleansing Ritual, and Rune Focus).</li>
</ul>
